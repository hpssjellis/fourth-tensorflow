# forth-tensorflow
Forth attempt at making tensorflow easier for windows users

.


Update Oct14, 2016.

Entered new 0.11 verison of tensorflow. Presently this is still a really long installation. Takes about 1 hour on cloud9. 

Update May 10, 2016

Moved setup files to the drafts location until they are ready to be integrated into the main setup.sh file. Look there for any GPU, torch, Open-Al-Gym setups.
